# Spring-boot-actuator demo project

Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot. It adds several production grade services to your application with little effort on your part. Actuators enable production-ready features to a Spring Boot application, without having to actually implement these things yourself. The Spring Boot Actuator is mainly used to get the internals of running application like health, metrics, info, dump, environment, etc. which is similar to your production environment monitoring setup.
